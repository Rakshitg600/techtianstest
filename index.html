            <h3>What is Breast Cancer?</h3>
            <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. It can affect both men and women, though it is far more common in women. There are several types of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, and invasive lobular carcinoma. Early detection through regular screenings like mammograms can greatly improve the chances of successful treatment. Understanding the specific type and stage of breast cancer is crucial for determining the most effective treatment plan.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>How Harmful is it?</h3>
            <p>Breast cancer can range from localized tumors to metastatic cancer that spreads to other parts of the body, including the bones, liver, lungs, and brain. The severity and risk of breast cancer depend on various factors such as the type, stage at diagnosis, and the patientâ€™s overall health. If not detected early, breast cancer can become life-threatening as it can metastasize, making treatment more complex and reducing the chances of survival. However, with advances in medical technology, treatments are becoming more effective, helping to reduce mortality rates.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Who is at Risk?</h3>
            <p>The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, with most cases diagnosed in women over 50. Other risk factors include a family history of breast cancer, inherited gene mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, early menstruation (before age 12), and late menopause (after age 55). Lifestyle factors, such as obesity, alcohol consumption, and hormone replacement therapy, can also elevate risk. Additionally, individuals who have had radiation therapy to the chest area in the past are at higher risk of developing breast cancer.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Precautions</h3>
            <p>Taking preventive measures can significantly lower the risk of developing breast cancer. These include maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, and limiting alcohol consumption. Breastfeeding, if possible, has also been shown to reduce risk. Women should consider regular screenings and discuss with their doctors when to begin mammograms based on their personal risk factors. In some high-risk cases, preventive surgery or medications may be recommended to lower the chances of developing breast cancer.</p>

            <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
            <p>Breast cancer treatment varies depending on the type and stage of the disease, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences. Common treatments include surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy), radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Some patients may also benefit from newer treatments like immunotherapy or participation in clinical trials. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the cancer, prevent its spread, and minimize the chance of recurrence while preserving as much of the breast as possible.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>While the exact cause of breast cancer is not fully understood, it is known that certain genetic mutations, particularly in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, significantly increase the risk. Environmental factors, such as exposure to radiation and certain chemicals, can also contribute. Hormonal factors, including long-term use of hormone replacement therapy, have been linked to an increased risk. Additionally, lifestyle choices, such as diet and physical activity, play a role in the development of breast cancer, though their impact varies from person to person.</p>
