                        <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. It can affect both men and women, though it is far more common in women. There are several types of breast cancer, including ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma, and invasive lobular carcinoma. Early detection through regular screenings like mammograms can greatly improve the chances of successful treatment. Understanding the specific type and stage of breast cancer is crucial for determining the most effective treatment plan.</p>
